README.MD

This is a simple placeholder site with a configuration file to illustrate building an enterprise style api.

It has a config directory and a site root directory. Inside the site root we have a basic placeholder index.php file and a (mostly) empty api directory.

The api's are the main part of the tutorial. The config directory is part of the api tutorial and contains site specific configuration settings that the api uses.

Once you clone this repo, cd to the api directory in this project and clone (or download via zip) the apis from the following repos:

Mobile Access Service (MAS)	:	https://github.com/appteur/SD_tutorial_simple_todo_api_mas
